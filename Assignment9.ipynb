    "Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a mechanism that allows the programmer to focus on the essential features of an object and ignore the non-essential details. The idea behind abstraction is to provide a simplified, high-level view of a complex system, making it easier to understand and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common example of abstraction in OOP is the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own but serves as a blueprint for other classes. An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements that interface. By defining an abstract class or an interface, a programmer can specify what a class should do without specifying how it should do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a scenario where you are designing a program to manage a library. You can define an abstract class called \"Book\" that contains essential properties such as the book's title, author, and ISBN number. Then, you can create concrete classes such as \"Novel,\" \"Textbook,\" and \"ComicBook\" that inherit from the \"Book\" class and provide additional, specific information. The \"Book\" class provides an abstract view of a book and the concrete classes provide a more detailed view.\n",

    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that are often used together to create well-designed, maintainable code. While they are related, they have distinct differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction refers to the ability to focus on the essential characteristics of an object and ignore the non-essential details. It is a way of representing complex systems in a simplified, high-level view. The goal of abstraction is to make a complex system more understandable and usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, refers to the bundling of data and functions that operate on that data within a single unit, or object. Encapsulation provides a way to protect the internal data of an object from being directly accessed and modified by code outside of that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference between abstraction and encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you are designing a program to model a bank account. You can define a class \"Account\" that contains both the data (e.g., account balance, account number, etc.) and the methods (e.g., deposit, withdraw, etc.) related to a bank account. This class provides a high-level view of a bank account and abstracts away the complex details of how a bank account works.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, you can use encapsulation to hide the internal data of the \"Account\" class from the outside world. By making the data members private and providing public methods to access and modify the data, you ensure that the internal state of the \"Account\" object can only be changed through the methods defined in the class. This protects the internal data of the object from being directly accessed and modified by code outside of the class, making it easier to maintain and update the code in the future.\n",

    "The \"abc\" (Abstract Base Classes) module in Python is used to define abstract base classes.

    "Ensuring a common interface: By defining an abstract base class, you can ensure that all concrete classes that inherit from it implement a common set of methods. This can make it easier to write generic code that works with objects from multiple concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing multiple inheritance: Python does not support multiple inheritance, but you can use abstract base classes as a way to achieve a similar result. By having a concrete class inherit from multiple abstract base classes, you can define a common interface for the concrete class that combines the methods from the abstract base classes.\n",

    "Implementing abstract methods: An abstract base class can define abstract methods that must be implemented by concrete classes that inherit from it.
